Bonus
=====

Your bonus solution always goes in the bonus subdirectory - capitalization matters! Again, *you must complete the full credit assignment to get any credit for the bonus assignment, and you must complete the bonus assignment to get any credit for the extreme bonus assignment!*

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Create a P01/bonus subdirectory, using e.g., ``cd ; mkcd cse1325/P01/bonus``.
2. Copy your full_credit solution, e.g., ``cp ../full_credit/hello.cpp .`` (note the trailing period, which means "this directory").
3. Edit hello.cpp to implement your solution to the bonus assignment.
4. Put hello.cpp into your GitHub repository. Try ``git add hello.cpp``, then ``git commit -m 'P01 b My first bonus draft'``, then ``git push``.
5. Compile your program using e.g., ``g++ hello.cpp``. Fix any compiler errors.
6. Update hello.cpp in your GitHub repository. with ``git add -u`` and ``git commit -m 'P01 b Bonus compiles'``, then ``git push``.
7. Run your program using e.g., ``./a.out``. Fix any runtime errors.
8. Update hello.cpp in your GitHub repository.
9. Run a lot of tests, including those suggested in the assignment.
10. Take one or more screenshots of your tests, and name them hello1.png, hello2.png, etc. using ``scrot -s hello1.png`` et. al., clicking your terminal window after each command to take the shot.
11. Add the screenshots to your GitHub repository. (Hint: ``git add hello*.png`` will add all of the images that start with ``hello`` and end with ``.png``)
