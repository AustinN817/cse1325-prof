Bonus
=====

Copy your Full Credit solution here, e.g., "``cp ../full_credit/*.cpp  ../full_credit/*.h .``".

Then edit color.h to specify each method listed in the PDF, and implement each method in color.cpp. in color.h and color.cpp, as outlined in the PDF. Your main program should still work just fine using "``make color && ./color``", except that magnitude will be shown by Color::to_string.

Once that works, add, commit, and push, then move on to the Extreme Bonus ("``cd ../extreme_bonus``")!
