Full Credit
===========

You are *encouraged* to continue with the code that you developed in P02. However, you are *allowed* to baseline the P02 suggested solution and continue from there with absolutely no penalty.

Whichever you choose, I suggest that you copy that code into P03. 

* A simple bash command, from the cse1325 directory, would be ``cp -r P02 P03`` to continue with your code or ``cp r ../cse1325-prof/P02 P03`` to baseline the suggested solution. However, feel free to use a file manager to arrange your code if you prefer.
* In either case, be sure to added the copied code to GitHub *before* you begin making changes. This makes it easy to see your changes for this assignment via, e.g., ``git difftool``.
